VOICE WIDGET 404 ERROR DEBUG INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

PROBLEM:
The voice widget is not appearing on https://theagentfactory.com because the widget script is returning a 404 error.

FAILING URL:
https://voice-agent-frontend-production-e709.up.railway.app/widget/v1/widget.js

EMBED CODE (in agentfactory/project index.html):
```html
<script src="https://voice-agent-frontend-production-e709.up.railway.app/widget/v1/widget.js" defer></script>
<voice-agent
  agent-id="ag_dWX5AH6n"
  position="bottom-right"
  theme="auto"
></voice-agent>
```

TASK:
Find why /widget/v1/widget.js returns 404. Look for:

1. Route definitions - Is there a route handler for /widget/v1/widget.js?
   - Check Express routes, Next.js pages/api, or whatever framework is used
   - Search for: "widget", "/v1/", "widget.js"

2. Static file serving - Is widget.js being built/served as a static file?
   - Check if there's a /public/widget/v1/widget.js
   - Check if there's a build step that creates widget.js
   - Check static file middleware configuration

3. Build process - Does widget.js get generated during build?
   - Check package.json scripts
   - Check webpack/vite/rollup config for widget bundle

4. Deployment - Is the widget code actually deployed to Railway?
   - Check railway.json or railway.toml config
   - Check if the build output includes the widget files

COMMANDS TO RUN:
```bash
# Find widget-related files
find . -name "*widget*" -type f

# Search for route definitions
grep -r "widget" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.tsx"

# Check for v1 routes
grep -r "/v1/" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"

# Look at build config
cat package.json
```

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
Either fix the route/build so /widget/v1/widget.js returns the widget JavaScript, or provide the correct URL that should be used in the embed code.
